# Welcome to the U.S. Emerging Citizen Technology Atlas

The Atlas is an open source resource organized by GSA's Emerging Citizen Technology Office (ECTO) for U.S. federal government emerging technologies, including Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Virtual and Augmented Reality and Social Technologies. Anyone from federal managers and policy-makers to U.S. businesses, researchers, and the public can analyze and update with:

1. Use cases for the practical application of emerging technologies;
2. Reports from public service workshops, pilots, and initiatives;
3. Paths to current programs in action right now;
4. Resources anyone can use for evaluation, testing, and potential adoption.

These pages include information provided directly from federal agencies evaluating and testing these new technologies, and like them should be considered a continual work-in-progress designed to empower you to know what we know and help us all be better informed to take advantage of new opportunities and avoid pitfalls. By their nature, emerging technologies evolve at a pace faster than traditional programs develop, which requires us to find new ways of working together.

This Atlas is a product of hundreds of contributions from across government to <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/technology/government-it-initiatives/emerging-citizen-technology">General Services Administration's Emerging Citizen Technology program</a> and its inter-agency Communities and initiatives, launched Oct. 11, 2017, and will evolve with the technologies and programs within it through contributions from federal agencies, private industry, and anyone interested in promoting emerging citizen technologies.
