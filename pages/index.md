<h2>Welcome to the U.S. Emerging Citizen Technology Atlas</h2>

<p dir="ltr">The U.S. Emerging Citizen Technology Atlas is an open source one-stop shop anyone can use and update with the latest use cases, reports, programs and resources for federal government emerging technology programs including Artificial Intelligence for Citizen Services, Blockchain, and soon Virtual and Augmented Reality and Social Technologies.</p> 

<p>These pages include information provided directly from federal agencies evaluating and testing these new technologies, and like them should be considered a continual work-in-progress designed to de-mystify what approaches are considered and opportunities to contribute analysis.</p> 

<p>In order for public services to best evaluate, test and where appropriate adopt new technologies to improve services for citizens and make them more cost effective for taxpayers, federal agencies must collaborate more openly with the U.S. businesses, policymakers and innovators who are critical to building transformational technology programs. By their nature, however, emerging technologies evolve at a pace faster than traditional programs develop, which requires us to find new ways of working together.</p> 

<p>This U.S. Emerging Citizen Technology Atlas, a product of the General Services Administrationâ€™s Emerging Citizen Technology program and its inter-agency Communities and initiatives, serves as an open resource to help see the ideas and programs shaping federal emerging technology, and with your contributions, will evolve with the technologies and programs within it.</p> 

<p>For more information on the U.S. Emerging Citizen Technology Atlas, contact Justin Herman, GSA Emerging Citizen Technology lead, at EmergingTech@gsa.gov.</p>

<p>Notably, we forked the design for this resource originally from the U.S. National Archives and Record Administration's Open Government Plan.</p>
