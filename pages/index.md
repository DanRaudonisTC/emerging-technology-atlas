# Welcome to the U.S. Emerging Citizen Technology Atlas

Emerging technologies can hold the key to unlocking the vast potential of public services and open data for the American people, but speed by which they evolve poses a challenge for evaluation for federal IT modernization. This U.S. Emerging Citizen Technology Atlas is an open source resource organized by GSA's Emerging Citizen Technology Office (ECTO) that anyone from federal managers and policy-makers to U.S. businesses, researchers, and the public can analyze and update with:

1. Use cases for the practical application of emerging technologies;
2. Reports from public service workshops, pilots, and initiatives;
3. Paths to programs in action right now;
4. Resources anyone can use

These pages include information provided directly from federal agencies evaluating and testing these new technologies, and like them should be considered a continual work-in-progress designed to empower you to know what we know and help us all be better informed to take advantage of new opportunities and avoid pitfalls. By their nature, emerging technologies evolve at a pace faster than traditional programs develop, which requires us to find new ways of working together.

This Atlas is a product of hundreds of contributions from across government to <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/technology/government-it-initiatives/emerging-citizen-technology">General Services Administration's Emerging Citizen Technology program</a> and its inter-agency Communities and initiatives, launched Oct. 11, 2017, and will evolve with the technologies and programs within it through contributions from federal agencies, private industry, and anyone interested in promoting emerging citizen technologies.
