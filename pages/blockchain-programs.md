## Blockchain Programs in Action

<p> In this section find and contribute quick reference links to current programs, initiatives, pilots, events, RFIs or other efforts in progress.</p>

<p> This section is in early states of development and should not be considered comprehensive.</p>

### Centers for Disease Control
For the past several months, the CDC’s Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services has worked on several proofs of concept based on blockchain technology, with an eye toward building real applications next year. Most are geared toward better public health surveillance, which could include using a blockchain to more efficiently manage data during a crisis or to better track opioid abuse.

### General Services Administration
Schedule 70: The General Services Administration (GSA) is using distributed ledger technology to automate the FASt Lane process for IT Schedule 70 contracts. The FAStlane program ensures government customer agencies have quicker access to emerging technologies and innovative suppliers. Currently the requirements are less than 48 hours for contract modifications, and 45 days (or less) for new offers. At the September 20 ACT-IAC (American Council for Technology and Industry Advisory Council) Forum Mr. Jose Arrieta unveiled the working prototype created by two companies, United Solutions (prime contractor) and Sapient Consulting (subcontractor). The prototype will shorten the time required to perform the contract review process into single digit days. This technology will allow the agency to track vendor data across disparate systems.

Office of Information Technology Category: GSA hosted a Blockchain Training Day (5.5 CLP) was delivered by subject matter experts to meet the objectives outlined in the Blockchain training curriculum. GSA is positioned to advise and assist the development of Blockchain proof-of-concepts and to assist agencies to prepare the procurement plans for proof-of-concepts. 

Emerging Citizen Technology: GSA's Emerging Citizen Technology program launched the government-wide Blockchain initiative, including both an internal federal community of more than 200 managers and a public-facing listserv of more than 100 U.S. businesses, researchers, subject matter experts and more. It also launched <a href="https://gsa.github.io/emerging-technology-atlas/blockchain-forum/">the U.S. Federal Blockchain Forum</a> and <a href="https://gsa.github.io/emerging-technology-atlas/blockchain-workshop/">"Emerging Tech and Open Data for a More Open Government,"</a> a workshop to draft the first potential national goals for Bockchain through Open Government, as well as this U.S. Emerging Citizen Technology Atlas.

### Department of Homeland Security 

<p> <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2017/01/10/snapshot-blockchain-technology-explored-homeland-security">The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (S&T)</a> is taking the lead with research and development projects in this area to determine viable uses for the technology. Cutting through the sensationalism associated with such a product, S&T sees the reality of blockchain’s promise. With such potential, proving the security and privacy aspects is precisely where S&T currently is focusing its resources. It is doing so via Small Business Innovation Research projects to investigate the various capabilities of blockchain. This includes security and privacy characteristics as well as exploring its immutability, data integrity and anti-spoofing aspects via a Silicon Valley Innovation Program project. If these research projects bear fruit, S&T will begin developing ways to implement blockchain technology to better safeguard the American people, our homeland and our values. </p>

### Department of State 

<p> On October 10, the State Department welcomed over 250 participants at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/blockchainstate-distributed-ledger-technologies-for-diplomacy-and-development-tickets-37669091266">the Blockchain@State forum</a> —a one-day, discovery workshop for the State Department, interagency partners, and private sector stakeholders to explore how blockchain technology could strengthen our capacity and improve our efficiency in meeting the United States’ diplomacy and development goals.  Participants represented over 150 different entities across the public-private spectrum.  Following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLhtdAiGq8">Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan’s opening remarks</a> underscoring the importance of innovation in diplomacy and development, participants engaged in dialogue with private sector partners currently using blockchain technology in the field with a focus on current use cases.  Speakers also examined potential approaches to embarking on a pilot project in partnership with other sectors.  Following the successful launch of its exploratory efforts, the State Department is currently considering possible next steps in this space.  The two recorded sessions from the forum can be <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/GPAtState/videos/?ref=page_internal">found here</a>; YouTube versions will be available soon.</p>

### State of Illinois 

<p> Illinois recently announced a consortium of Illinois state and county agencies, known as the Illinois Blockchain Initiative, who will collaborate to explore innovations presented by Blockchain and distributed ledger technology. DoIT is actively engaged in this effort. The goal of the initiative is to determine if this groundbreaking technology can be leveraged to create more efficient, integrated and trusted state services, while providing a welcoming environment for the Blockchain community. Blockchain and distributed ledger technology has the potential to transform the delivery of public and private services, redefine the relationship between government and the citizen in terms of data sharing, transparency and trust, and make a leading contribution to the State’s digital transformation.
