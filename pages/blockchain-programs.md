<p> Event: Use of Blockchain in Healthcare and Research Workshop</p>

### Department of State 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/blockchainstate-distributed-ledger-technologies-for-diplomacy-and-development-tickets-37669091266">Event: Blockchain@State, 10/11/17</a></p> 

<p> On October 10, the State Department welcomed over 250 participants at the Blockchain@State forum —a one-day, discovery workshop for the State Department, interagency partners, and private sector stakeholders to explore how blockchain technology could strengthen our capacity and improve our efficiency in meeting the United States’ diplomacy and development goals.  Participants represented over 150 different entities across the public-private spectrum.  Following Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan’s opening remarks underscoring the importance of innovation in diplomacy and development, participants engaged in dialogue with private sector partners currently using blockchain technology in the field with a focus on current use cases.  Speakers also examined potential approaches to embarking on a pilot project in partnership with other sectors.  Following the successful launch of its exploratory efforts, the State Department is currently considering possible next steps in this space.  The two recorded sessions from the forum can be found here; YouTube versions will be available soon.</p>

### Department of Homeland Security 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2017/01/10/snapshot-blockchain-technology-explored-homeland-security">Post: Snapshot: Blockchain Technology Explored for Homeland Security, 1/10/17</a></p> 
<p> The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) is taking the lead with research and development projects in this area to determine viable uses for the technology. Cutting through the sensationalism associated with such a product, S&T sees the reality of blockchain’s promise. With such potential, proving the security and privacy aspects is precisely where S&T currently is focusing its resources. It is doing so via Small Business Innovation Research projects to investigate the various capabilities of blockchain. This includes security and privacy characteristics as well as exploring its immutability, data integrity and anti-spoofing aspects via a Silicon Valley Innovation Program project. If these research projects bear fruit, S&T will begin developing ways to implement blockchain technology to better safeguard the American people, our homeland and our values. </p>
