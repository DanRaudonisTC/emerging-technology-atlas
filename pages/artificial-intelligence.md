# Artificial Intelligence for Citizen Services


<p>Public services are increasingly powered through the combination of greater access to data and pratical advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning that liberate solutions from research and development laboratories and into the hands of program managers anywhere. At this cross-section of technological advances and public-facing services is the Artificial Intelligence for Citizen Services program, designed to work with agencies across government, U.S. businesses, researchers and the public to improve customer services, civic participation and access for the American people.</p>

<p>GSA’s Emerging Citizen Technology Program <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2016/11/30/sharing-public-service-visions-for-virtual-reality-and-artificial-intelligence/">launched the Artificial Intelligence for Citizen Services program</a> in October, 2016 to unite public service managers and innovative U.S. businesses in evaluating and building smart automation solutions.</p>

<p>We launched an open-source pilot that helped dozens of federal programs make their services available to consumer intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) like Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana, Google Assistant, and Facebook Messenger. We’re working with client agencies to prepare business cases understanding the impact of these advances in Artificial Intelligence on Citizen Services.</p>
