<p>Public services are increasingly powered through the combination of greater access to data and practical advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning that deliver solutions from research and development laboratories into the hands of programs everywhere.</p>

<p>The Artificial Intelligence for Citizen Services program is designed to collaborate with agencies across government, U.S. businesses, researchers, and the public to improve customer services, civic participation, and access for the American people.</p>

<p>For example, the first project of the inter-agency Artificial Intelligence for Citizen Services Community was to launch an open-source pilot that helped dozens of federal programs evaluate and test opening their services to consumer intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) like Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana, Google Assistant, and Facebook Messenger.</p>

<p>In this section, you will find practical use cases from collaborators for how the government can approach Artificial Intelligence to improve citizen-facing programs, reports from federal workshops and initiatives, links to programs in action, and resources anyone can use.</p>
