##### Source: Concepts developed by teams during the workshop 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Apprenticeship For American Innovation: Use growth in AI, IOT & Smart Cities as an apparatus to make transparent solutions for two administration goals: apprenticeships that create job ready skills, and infrastructure development for job creation & security. Key Objectives include: use of analytics to develop smart city workforce requirements; use of existing datasets & machine learning to baseline smart city infrastructure.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. OpenAI.Gov: an Open AI framework / repository / standards to support architecture for chatbots & citizen services. Key Objectives include: AI collaboration / asset sharing; central entry point federated AI services to assist citizens; contextually relevant answers to citizens. Measureable metrics include: citizens interacting with openai.gov; responses marked “useful” appropriate; federal services connected; AI projects shared and used by others; productivity & savings due to tech / info sharing (e.g. costs, time, etc.)</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Making AI in the Justice System open and accountable: promoting the use and development of open data and open source software for risk-assessment and case management in the criminal justice system. Key Objectives include: mandating that any risk-assessment software used on the federal level has open source code, training data, and machine learning technique; creating taskforce to study, report, and encourage nation-wide adoption of open source risk-assessment and case management tools. Measureable Metrics include: taskforce creation; decrease in federal jail population; increase state uptake of open source tools, reduction in state jail and prison populations, decrease recidivism rate, taxpayers savings and lower crime rate.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Federal Skill Finder Service (FSFS): transparently matching biggest needs with best skills. Key Objectives include: more quickly and more effectively match federal workforce and applicants to opportunities and needs; provide transparency to those seeking opportunities. Measureable metrics include: reduced time-to-hire; improved EVS scores; improved ability to mobilize resources & respond to crisis.</p>
