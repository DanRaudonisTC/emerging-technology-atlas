<p>
</p>

<p>1. Transaction validation</p>

<p>2. Software license management</p>

<p>3. Security documentation sharing</p>

Blockchain could be applied as an enhanced security and validation tool to create digital identities that protect this private sector information and maintain privacy.</p>

<p>17. Cross-domaining solutions to ensure security and audit-ability when moving information across automatically across security classifications.</p>
