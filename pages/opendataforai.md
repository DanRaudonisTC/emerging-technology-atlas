We understand the critical role that federal government open data plays as fuel for Artificial Intelligence innovation, and look forward to collaborating with [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) and the [Data Cabinet](https://ntis.gov/thedatacabinet/)  more in 2018 to identify opportunities to better coordinate between federal agencies and private sector innovators to operationalize the vast wealth of federal open data. 

If you would like to contribute to this ongoing effort, please email EmergingTech@GSA.gov with "#AIOpenData" in the subject field.
