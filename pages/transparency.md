Forming an open marketplace, where any online merchant store can join and re-market, auction the same inventory in sync with global network of such intermediary online stores.</p>

<p>43. Reduce the high overhead cost of traditional trade finance solutions through commercial banks to help small businesses export American products overseas. Explore blockchain applications for trade finance insurance and government-backed working capital guarantee products. Coordinate with commercial banks to facilitate integration with their trade finance blockchain solutions as they develop theirs.</p>

Management of clinical trial protocols, data, and patient databases using blockchain ledgers.</p>

<p>44. etermine the feasibility of using blockchain in a permission-based DLT platform as the foundation for a government-wide software license entitlement exchange as mandated by Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA).

<p>45. Pilot program for fresh produce contracts/procurements by school districts with USDA approved vendors to utilize entitlement funds and enhance local procurement volume. Orders, receipts, bills of lading, invoices, approved vendors and products visibility for USDA agencies, state agencies, school districts and vendors to verify compliance with pilot rules, auditability and ensure prompt payment. Currently 2 federal agencies, 8 states, 400+ school districts and 90+ vendors participate in a manual validation and tracking process.</p>
