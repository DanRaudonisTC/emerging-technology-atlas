Yet, Gartner estimates 90% of enterprise blockchain projects launched in 2015 will fail within 18 to 24 months. Part of the problem is that the majority of enterprise blockchain projects don’t actually require blockchain technology. In fact, these projects would probably be more successful if they did not utilize blockchain...."
